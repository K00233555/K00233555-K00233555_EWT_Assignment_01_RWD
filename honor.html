    Summary: Over the course of a 27-year career, the Oakland band has evolved from metallic punk to post-hardcore prog to majestic doom of their current phase.
</div> 
    
   <p class = "reviewParagraph">
    
    "Our legacy can only be assured if we continually burn down the past and plant seeds in the ashes," proclaims Neurosis guitarist-vocalist Steve Von Till in a trailer for the band's latest album, Honor Found in Decay. It's got a nice ring to it, but might not be the best description of the veteran Oakland group's M.O. Sure, Neurosis' work has evolved over the course of a 27-year career-- from the gritty metallic punk of 1987's Pain of Mind to the harrowing post-hardcore prog of 1993's Enemy of the Sun and on to the majestic art doom of their current phase-- but the progression has been gradual, a series of seasonal shifts rather than fiery upheavals. That unhurried pace has helped make the band into a redwood of the underground, a model for Mastodon, Isis, and countless other crews of metal-oriented aesthetes.
    </p> 
    
    
    <p class = "reviewParagraph">
    It's telling that Honor's two strongest tracks, opener "We All Rage in Gold" and closer "Raise the Dawn", are also the shortest. These pieces sum up how the record conveys an expansive feel while minimizing fuss. More importantly, they straight-up rock. After a quick mood-setting intro, "We All Rage in Gold" kicks into a badass midtempo groove-- the closest Neurosis has come to boogie-- with Kelly growling ruefully on top. 
        </p> 
    
    
     <p class = "reviewParagraph">
Honor's longer tracks are hit-and-miss. "At the Well"-- like "Raise the Dawn", a staple of the band's live sets since late 2010-- is a textbook Neurosis epic, formulaic but effective. The track stretches out from Von Till's dark-troubadour opening into elegiac doom, growing gradually more intense. When the drums drop out six minutes in, it's a dead giveaway for the torrential burst that follows; still, the shift is a stunner. Like seasoned horror directors, Neurosis know how to shake you up while abiding by convention. In contrast, "Casting of the Ages" lacks a narrative arc. Like the Neurosis equivalent of a power ballad, the track follows a straightforward whisper-then-roar format, simply trudging on until it ends. A song like this makes it easy to miss the more feral sound of Enemy of the Sun and 1992's Souls at Zero, records that privileged phantasmagoric sensory overload over tidy compositional logic. 
    
    </p> 
    
    
 <p class = "reviewParagraph">
 
Thankfully, the next track, "All Is Found...In Time", reestablishes tension. Here, the band sets aside brooding in favor of geeky psychedelic intrigue. Drummer Jason Roeder's tom-tom-heavy pummel leads the group through a cosmic-prog overture, which segues into a bluesy half-time heave; then Landis' Pink Floyd-style synths point the way to a kitschy yet ominous interlude. When the intro returns with a jolt, the ground seems to rush away, as though a shuttle simulator had malfunctioned, blasting the listener into deep space. Moments like these help make Honor Found in Decay feel like a fresh start, even though the band's core palette hasn't changed. It's a record that proves these grizzled artisans still know how to flex their muscles.
