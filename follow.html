<div class = "summary">Summary: Anger is not pretty or pleasant. It can turn violent, even homicidal. But there are times when just getting mad beats getting even, when that backlog of resentment and helplessness is something to be exorcised

   <p class = "reviewParagraph">
    Korn know where that's at. In Follow the Leader, vocalist Jonathan Davis, bassist Reggie "Fieldy" Arvizu, guitarists James "Munky" Shaffer and Brian "Head" Welch, and drummer David Silveria have made an ideal record for those long, black days when all you can do is stand up and scream, "What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!" at bloody-murder volume.
    
    </p> 
    
    
    <p class = "reviewParagraph">
        In attack and distemper, Korn have the Nineties hip-hop, amp-death aesthetic — NIN meet N.W.A; Rollins Against the Machine — down to ferocious perfection. "Children of the Korn" is an emergency-transmission mélange of brittle machine beats, densely packed guitar distortion and the tandem barking of Davis ("All I want to do is live!") and special guest Ice Cube ("Stop fuckin' wit' me!"). A smart, sharp example of Korn's style of modular writing, "Seed" is two mind games in one: big chunks of deathmarch funk and opaque stretches of echoey dub in which the guitars sound as though they're broadcasting from a watery grave.

     </p> 
    
    
     <p class = "reviewParagraph">
 Follow the Leader is also true to an older, vital hard-rock tradition of cleansing brutality and transcendent guitar choler — Blue Cheer's 1968 speed freak's delight, Vincebus Eruptum; early Metallica and very early Black Sabbath; the molten heave 'n' thump of Funkadelic's "Cosmic Slop"; the claustrophobic fury of Steve Albini's mid-Eighties band Big Black. It may be the fact that Shaffer and Welch both play seven-string guitars, but there is an extra, weighty abrasion to their riffing that, at full throttle, seems to cleave the music in half, pressing everything else in the mix toward the margins. Silveria's bona fide disco beat is the sucker bait in "Got the Life," but it's the crisp crush of bass-and-dual-guitar menace that makes the track fat with tension. When the band abruptly switches from the cold, clipped chorus of "It's On" to the bright, Big Chord bridge, it's as if Korn have suddenly stepped out of their angst bunker into A-bomb-white daylight.
    
    </p> 
    
    <p class = "reviewParagraph">
 
Korn's only other problem is timing; they've released their best album just as alternative punk-funk-metal whatever is in commercial and creative eclipse. It is easy to hear in Follow the Leader the last great roar of a once-good idea. It is also easy, from a music-biz perch, to misread and underestimate the needs and loyalties of Young Pissed-off America. Either way, Follow the Leader is going to blow up in your face. Prepare to eat shrapnel — whether you like it or not.
