   <p class = "reviewParagraph">
   Compared to its predecessors, David Bowie's 11th studio album is noticeably reserved. His lyrical gifts were already spread thin, and thinner still when a completed third verse was cut from "Always Crashing in the Same Car," in which Bowie did his very best Bob Dylan impression. Producer Tony Visconti thought it was so creepy, and potentially inappropriate given Dylan's motorcycle accident a decade earlier, that they scrapped it.
    </p> 
    
    
    <p class = "reviewParagraph">
    Low's first side is a beautiful futurist ruin, littered with holes left purposefully unfixed. Visconti heightens the decay and distills the lifespan of every sound, treating Dennis Davis' drums so that he was playing along to a withered echo of his last strike, like an explosion contained in a tin can. Even Bowie's voice sounds aged and distant. Eno's sharp electronics jostle against the bolshy funk rhythms and Carlos Alomar and Ricky Gardiner's guitars, giving the record a feverish euphoria that hits like too much pseudo-ephedrine and mangles linear time. Low's first side feels like having the carpet ripped out from under you by three wizards who have plans to fly it elsewhere.
    </p> 
    
    
     <p class = "reviewParagraph">
   All this playfulness means that Low's reputation for utter desolation doesn't feel quite right. Bowie is, of course, obsessed with barriers to connection: the sudden instinct that causes him to yelp and back away from someone on "Breaking Glass" ("You're such a wonderful person/ But you got problems/ Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'll never touch ya"), self-imposed isolation ("Sound and Vision") and isolation from the self ("What are you gonna be/ To the real me," on "What in the World"), and a semi-serious plea for lifelong companionship just as his marriage was disintegrating ("Be My Wife"). </p> 
    
    
  <p class = "reviewParagraph">
  At the end of side 1 comes the instrumental "A New Career in a New Town," which plots the distance from Bowie's Anglocentric career to his new Teutonic mode, bridging the former's refractory squelched riff and the latter's dreamy gauze with a searching harmonica phrase: a regular substitute for emotion that the human voice can't reach, but a brilliantly strange idea in this context (as well as another Dylan affectation). Here, it's bittersweet, nostalgic but propelled by forward motion, and a resolution to commit to a place and escape his blue room funk. The mostly instrumental second side is a tribute to the people of the Soviet Bloc Poland on "Warszawa," and East Berlin on the remaining three songs—in which the elusive nature of side 1 subsides and Bowie's persona is subsumed into his and Eno's pulsating sequences. </p>
